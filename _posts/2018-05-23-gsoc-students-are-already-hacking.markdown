We always enjoy that new people join openSUSE community and help them in their first steps. Because of that, [openSUSE participates again in GSoC](https://news.opensuse.org/2018/02/19/gsoc-ana), an international program in which stipends are awarded to students who hack on open source projects during the summer. We are really excited to announce that this year four students will learn about open source development while hacking on openSUSE projects. The coding period started last week, so our students are already busy hacking and they have written some nice articles about their projects. ;)
