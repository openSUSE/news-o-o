<p>The openSUSE.Asia Summit is an annual openSUSE Asian conference, attended by
  contributors and enthusiasts from all over Asia. The event focuses primarily on
  the openSUSE distribution and community, its applications for personal and enterprise
  use, and open source culture. Since 2014, openSUSE.Asia Summit events had been held
  offline and thus, a great opportunity for the community to meet. </p>  
  However, due to COVID-19, the summit was canceled in 2020.In 2021,the online summit
  was organized by the team India.
