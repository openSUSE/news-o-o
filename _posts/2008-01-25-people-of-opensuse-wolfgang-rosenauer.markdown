#### Please introduce yourself!


I was born in 1975 in Germany (in the same city where I'm living meanwhile). I'm married and have two little children.
Currently I'm working for Joost from my home office.






#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


I started with a C64 in the age of 9 but at this point mainly for gaming ;-) but not only (I had my first BASIC course on C64 in the age of 11). Then I went trough C128, Amiga before I arrived at my first PC (80286).






#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


I ordered my first S.u.S.E. Linux 5.1 in December 1997 because my professor for computer science was really enthusiastic about Linux and told us in every lesson what a "real" operating system is.

So I bought a magazine which had a comparison between different Linux distributions. S.u.S.E. Linux was quite positive in that comparison but in the end the fact that S.u.S.E. was located in Fuerth was the decisive one since it was the nearest vendor (like supporting local vendors).






#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


Specifically the "openSUSE" community?
Then I joined when it was started being an employee of SUSE at this point.

If the "SUSE" community also counts I basically joined in 1999 when I was first employed by S.u.S.E. GmbH.






#### In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?


Currently I'm using, testing, fixing various stuff of openSUSE if I can. Basically for applications/features I need/use myself.

The biggest part of my work for openSUSE is maintaining (almost) all Mozilla applications (in the Buildservice) since that's what I've done from 2001 on.






#### What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?


Improving my favourite Linux distribution.






#### What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you're most proud of?


No idea.






#### When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?


When I don't sleep and work on my computer.
Actually I'm lurking on IRC then even if I actually do my real work.






#### Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!


Most usable Linux (while that is already an official slogan I personally think it's actually what it is and what it should be in future).






#### What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?


Documentation might be a bit underrated. At least I think for newbies it's very hard to find even existing documentation.






#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?


Growth.






#### A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?


I'm not a good salesman and refrain from trying to convince people. If they are open to try it themselves I'd help as good as possible and I'm pretty sure that if they try it they will stay (or come back after they've tried something else).






#### Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?


Most of the Novell/SUSE employees obviously and only a few others.






#### How many icons are currently on your desktop?


WindowMaker has no real icons. (I'm lazy to switch to something else as long it does what I want).






#### What is the application you can't live without? And why?


I think there is no single application. I can't live without "a webbrowser" or "a mail user agent". I have preferences based on current usage but nothing I couldn't live without.






#### Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?


I have two things left which I need Windows for



	
  * the configuration application for my PBX

	
  * a (usable comfortable) tax software


That are almost the only things I really miss because they force me to have some Windows somewhere.






#### Which is your preferred text editor? And why?


vim. Because it works quite well and I know how to use it.






#### Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?


I don't really care while depending how famous the person would be it would probably be good marketing.






#### Which computer related skills would you like to have?


Too many to list.






#### The Internet crashes for a whole week — how would you feel, what would you do?


If it not only crashes for me I would feel fine and would spend more time with my family.






#### Which is your favorite movie scene?


Can't remember anything really remarkable.






#### Star Trek or Star Wars?


Star Trek (while Star Wars or most other Science Fiction is quite ok for me).






#### What is your favorite food and drink?


I have no special favourites.






#### Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?


Nowadays I only play bzflag if any (but very rarely). From my childhood I can well remember Wing Commander where I actually owned 1-5 + Armada.(I still have most of them somewhere).






#### Which city would you like to visit?


Quite a lot. I haven't visited too many yet.






#### What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?


I've enjoyed beach holidays in the past and still like them.






#### Someone gives you $1.000.000 — what would you do with the money?


Buy a few things and redeem money for my house.






#### If traveling through time was possible — when would we be most likely to meet you?


Depends on how the future look like and in worst case in the present.






#### There's a thunderstorm outside — do you turn off your computer?


Usually not. Why would I?






#### Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?


Quite often.






#### Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!


(none)






#### You couldn't live without...


Many things: My family, the Internet ...






#### Which question was the hardest to answer?


There were more questions equally hard to answer.






#### What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?


(none)
