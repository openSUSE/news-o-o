This week saw a major transition in [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org/) [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) for [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/) as it moved to a new major version. 

Several other packages like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [GVfs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [KDE Plasma 5.27.9](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.27.9/) and [Frameworks](https://kde.org/announcements/frameworks/5/5.111.0/) updated in the rolling release this week.

[KDE Plasma 5.27.9](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.27.9/) arrives in snapshot [20231025](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/LK4AQ7SM4SA4F6GJSN744BC2TTE6S2VH/). The latest update for the [Plasma Desktop](https://kde.org/) makes implements changes to avoid recursively adding every copied file to the desktop. Its recent files component ensures compatibility with an older Frameworks version of [kconfigwidgets](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kconfigwidgets/html/index.html). [Kwin](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin) resolves a misgenerated `QHoverEvent` and enhances functionality by adding `QKeySequence` functionality to a part of the Virtual Desktop Manager. An update of [firewalld](https://firewalld.org/) 2.0.1 resolves issues related to the command-line interface (CLI) by ensuring that the `--list-all-zones` output is consistent and that the default zone attribute is correctly displayed. Active attributes for zones and policies are shown accurately, and the `--get-active-zones` command includes the default zone. There were also enhancements in the [nftables](https://git.netfilter.org/nftables/) integration, so the main table is now always flushed upon the start. Several other issues were resolved, including the proper usage of [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) names for [ICMPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMPv6) and the configuration of IP ranges and values for ipsets when working with nftables. Updates for [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) users also arrived in the snapshot. An update of [gnome-control-center](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center) 45.1 includes enhancing the ability to close the Cursor Size and Shortcuts dialogs using the Escape key. It also supports more types of processors in the About section. A lower timeout when downloading service files, which leads to improved performance was made in the [gnome-maps](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-maps) 45.1. This snapshot also updates [gnome-terminal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal) to version 3.50.1, which has checks for alternate terminals within the [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) environment and improves the handling of the headerbar preference. The second [kernel-firmware](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git) of the month to version 20231019 fixes the robot email script, updates [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) CPU microcode and introduces support for sending emails during PR/patch processing. The 7.2.2 version of [redis](https://redis.io/) has a critical [Common Vulnerability and Exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) fix; [CVE-2023-45145](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45145.html) creates a race condition that potentially leads to unauthorized Unix socket permissions upon startup, which had existed since the 2.6.0 release candidate version. Several more packages were updated in the snapshot.

Snapshot [20231023](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/2DPU4IJJPBQJ637NL5AEO4EVYGMGQZHV/) brought updates of some [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) packages like [gvfs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs), [evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) and [gnome-software](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software) 45.1. The latter update brings various styling fixes, an ability to report [PackageKit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/PackageKit/) [GPG](https://gnupg.org/)-related errors in the graphical user interface and it improves [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) permission checks. The update also includes translation updates. With [evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) 3.50.1, the personal information management application fixes bugs like correcting the conversion of [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) encoded text files, enabling spell checking for editable fields and updates default calendar colors. A fix warning about the failure to solve a puzzle when loading games was made in the [gnome-sudoku](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Sudoku) 45.2 update. Another [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) package to update was [gvfs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs) 1.52.1. This Virtual filesystem implementation addresses issues including the prevention of returning invalid mount cache entries in the client, fixes authentication problems when using [DNS-Service Discovery](http://www.dns-sd.org/) Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) and resolves [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) URI handling problems in the Network File System component. An update of [harfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz) 8.2.2 fixes a regression from 8.1.0 in shaping fonts with duplicate feature tags and resolves a regression from in parsing CSS-style feature strings. The update of[virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 7.0.12 addresses multiple [CVEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) like [CVE-2023-22098](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-22098.html), [CVE-2023-22099](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-22099.html) and [CVE-2023-22100](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-22100.html), which would lead to can lead to unauthorized access and system crashes. Several other packages were updated in the snapshot including [rubygem-agama](https://rubygems.org/gems/agama) 5, which has enhancements like not reusing pre-existing swap partitions in the storage proposal, extends the Software service to configure selected patterns and adapts storage settings for [ALP Dolomite](https://documentation.suse.com/alp/dolomite/html/alp-dolomite/index.html).

The update of [apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/) 2.4.58 arrives in snapshot [20231022](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/WGX2J7NJP6EF6E4WYZK2LOTUKZ5V5WRV/). Apache2 addresses [CVE-2023-45802](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45802.html), which relates to stream memory management, and [CVE-2023-43622](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-43622.html), which addresses a DoS vulnerability. The updates include various improvements like enhanced support for WebSockets via HTTP/2 and the introduction of new directives for better control and logging in various scenarios. A 16.2.14.66 update of [ceph](https://ceph.io/) takes care of issues related to minimal file system [BlueFS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-ceph/5?topic=bluestore-ceph-bluefs) and enables a 4K allocation unit for it. The package also enables building for [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/). An update of [dracut](https://dracut.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) addresses issues related to FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) setup that was causing test failures and core dumps in various test scenarios. An update of the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) had enhancements for [Advanced Linux Sound Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture) among other things. The [kernel-source](https://www.kernel.org/) 6.5.8 package has network-related component changes, such as net drivers and protocols, and addresses other issues with audio and sound support like that of [ALSA System on Chip](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/sound/soc/platform.html) for a non-functioning mic on [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com) 82YM. An update of [pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) 0.3.83 fixes a regression, reduces memory usage in audio conversion and removes the buffer-size limit with [JACK](https://jackaudio.org/). The update of [xfce4-terminal](https://gitlab.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-terminal) 1.1.1 improves [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) and [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compatibility. Among the other packages to update were [libstorage-ng](https://github.com/openSUSE/libstorage-ng) 4.5.149, [yast2-storage-ng](https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng) 5.0.3, [freerdp](https://www.freerdp.com/) 2.11.2 and more.

The update of the [man](https://manpages.opensuse.org/) package 2.12.0 in snapshot [20231020](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/44TV6N3JUAJ4W353LS7F74LY2PLUGFD2/) addresses manual page portability issues and enables timestamps beyond [2038](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) for the Y2K38 event that’s a long time away.An update of [nftables](https://git.netfilter.org/nftables/) 1.0.9 introduces improvements like custom conntrack timeouts and better support for dynamic sets. Plus it fixes a crash with a log prefix longer than 127 bytes. The [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) 3.43.2 update fixes memory leaks, and enhances the JSON processing performance. The version also adds support for Full-Text Search version 5 (FTS5) Indexes that allows for the deletion of indexed records without retaining the content of the deleted records. A ton of version 5 packages in the snapshot align YaST's versioning with SUSE versions and the service packs it supports; more than 50 [yast2](https://github.com/yast/yast-yast2) packages transitioned to version 5 to align with one of SUSE’s next major releases.

[KDE](https://kde.org) Plasma users who did a `zypper dup` with snapshot [20231019](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/VTQ4WWG7UKXJNGCYASW2GTPFJYXAESOC/) and later received [KDE Frameworks 5.111.0](https://kde.org/announcements/frameworks/5/5.111.0/) updates.

The [libnvme](https://github.com/linux-nvme/libnvme) 1.6+5 update fixes an issue by avoiding stack corruption caused by unaligned direct memory access to user space buffers, as [reported](https://github.com/linux-nvme/libnvme/pull/727). The regular expressions library   [oniguruma](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma) updates to version 6.9.9 in the snapshot. This update includes updating Unicode to version 15.1.0, introducing a new API called and, addressing issues related to character classes and [POSIX brackets](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions). Rendering library [virglrenderer](https://software.opensuse.org/package/virglrenderer) had its first major release with version 1.0.0. The update transitions to the Venus protocol, eliminating the experimental label from the Venus configuration option. This release also improves the handling of fences between guest and host for synchronization purposes. More major versions of YaST 5 arrived and there were a few other updates to include a 4.19.2 version of [samba](https://www.samba.org/).

Only three packages updated in snapshot [20231018](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/factory@lists.opensuse.org/thread/PU3NO2S35IJRIQGHIVDM2QAT76LZ3VJ6/) from last week that did not make it in our weekly review.
