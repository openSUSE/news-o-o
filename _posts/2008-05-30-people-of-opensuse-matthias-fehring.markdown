#### Please introduce yourself!


I was born almost 26 years ago in the Westphalian province in Germany, where I lived the most time of my hithero life with my three sisters and my parents in a small, but really funny village named Eissen (which can also be found in the German and English Wikipedia ;-) ) on the farm of my parents. Currently I am  living in Dresden, where I studied political science, philosophy and German literature, and where I now write my thesis. In the moment of answering this questions I am single and have no pets. ;-)






#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


The first computer I could use was an i386SX 16MHz PC, which my father needed in the beginning of the 90s (I think 1991) for an agricultural management application (Ackerschlagkartei, which had a funny LPT-Dongle). I used it mostly for playing. Doom II leaded to a full hard disk, so that some files of my father must go away; but I survived that.

I have tried some times to learn programming, but it seems as it should not be. ;-)

I use my computer(s) today mostly for writing, communication, multimedia, web browsing and playing (mostly RPG and Strategy). And I think, I can not live without an internet flatrate. :-D I have one since this payment model is available in Germany.






#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


My first contact to Linux and SUSE Linux was SUSE Linux 6.2 which I bought together with a friend. The motivation was the old "Windows annoyances".... But this motivation did not lead quickly to a big love. So the most time the box collected dust in the rack. But at times the boredom hit me and I installed it many times new. It was more a game to install it, then really usage. But with SUSE Linux 7.0 I started to use it regularly and after some time I used Windows only for playing games. In the meantime I tried also Ubuntu, Gentoo and CCux Linux, but went always back to SUSE Linux. By the way: Two month ago, my mother found the old SL 6.2 box on the attic. I am not nostalgic and throw it away... ;-)






#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


I think, I started to write in the openSUSE wiki since it is there. I was pleased that the best distribution became completely open. My motivation is the joy of writing and to be part of the community. Short: to have fun :)






#### In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?


I write in the German openSUSE wiki and I am a sys-op there. Since some time I also build some little packages in the build service, in my home project and in KDE:KDE4:*:Community.






#### What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?


Mostly the fun to write and to be part of the community. I like the idea of freedom.






#### What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you're most proud of?


Ouh, I do not know. Maybe the package management howtos in the German wiki?






#### When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?


When I have time for it. :)






#### Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!


Easy, innovative, free.






#### What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?


Good central forums (I know, they are on the way).






#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?


The evolution goes on.






#### A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?


YaST and Build Service, and for Germans the great userbase in the German language area.






#### Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?


No one.






#### How many icons are currently on your desktop?


One, the trash can plasmoid. And the analog clock plasmoid, but that is not an icon, isn't it?






#### What is the application you can't live without? And why?


There is more than one. Kontact (KDEPIM), Kopete, Amarok, Firefox (in no order) I think the cause for this list is self explaining. ;-)






#### Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?


It would be nice when KDEPIM already uses Akonadi. But anticipation is the greatest joy. :-)






#### Which is your preferred text editor? And why?


Kate, because of syntax highlighting, session management and many other nice features.






#### Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?


I give nothing to celebs.






#### Which computer related skills would you like to have?


Programming would be nice, but I fear that ends like my wish to can play bagpipe. But who knows...






#### The Internet crashes for a whole week ” how would you feel, what would you do?


Shit happens, but good time for drinking more beer with many friends. Or to read anymore books.






#### Which is your favorite movie scene?


There are too many movies, but I would say the scene in "Hot Fuzz", when the old man beats the sea mine with his rifle.






#### Star Trek or Star Wars?


I do not like them both really, but from this selection I would choose Star Wars.






#### What is your favorite food and drink?


Drink: beer, coffee, wine, the most natural juices, milk and water

Food: probably all, but as Westphalian I really like Himmel und Erde (Sky and Earth, mashed potatoes mixed with apple compote) with fried black pudding and onions.






#### Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?


In the past Pirates! and Monkey Island I and II and today the Gothic serial, the Total War serial, Sacred and the Spellforce serial.






#### Which city would you like to visit?


Many.






#### What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?


Driving around with a car, camping and make a little bit sightseeing and taste the regional beer. Or only enjoy the spare time to read anymore books and make party.






#### Someone gives you $1.000.000 ” what would you do with the money?


At first I would give a big party. Then I will invest the rest (I hope there will be a rest) to make it more. If it is enough I will try to buy one of the best breweries in the world: Schloßbrauerei Rheder ;-)






#### If traveling through time was possible ” when would we be most likely to meet you?


March 18, 1848 on the barricades in Berlin.






#### There's a thunderstorm outside ” do you turn off your computer?


No, should I? My computers survived an electronical failure in the house connection of the power line, which killed many other devices. So, I have no more fear.






#### Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?


Again and again, but the same happens also while reading books or magazines...






#### Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!


The view out of my window in Dresden.






#### You couldn't live without...


Computer/internet, beer, music, books, my friends, my family; all the things that makes the life nice.






#### Which question was the hardest to answer?


All the "What is your favorite...." questions, where the selection was to small....






#### What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?


Why Buschmann (engl. bushman) as nickname?
This is not because of my hairs! ;-) I got this name when they was really short. The origin of the name is Half-Life Deathmatch, where I used a character like a cannibal. This brought one of my friends about to call me Buschmann, and over the time many other people, which never played the game, start to call me so, too.
