#### Please introduce yourself!


I was born in Wismar. After studying in Rostock for a while I got the offer to work at SuSE and I moved to Nuremberg. So here we are. Best job you can get. Nuremberg just misses the sea. But you can't have everything.






#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


I started with a [KC85/4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC85). I got my own one at home. Used it for playing with my brothers and sisters and a bit basic programming. At some point it broke and as the GDR gone as well it was hard to repair it. So I had a few years without an own computer, but I helped my friends with their PC problems anyway. In 1994 I got my own PC (dx4/100). It got OS/2 on it. But I quickly killed that one for Win95. I tried to install some Slackware version on it but it failed horribly. So I sticked to Windows NT for a while.






#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


1997/1998 somewhere around that. A friend at the university gave me his SuSE 5.2 CDs and I tried it. Of course the first install didn't survived very long. "chmod -R 600 .*" is not a good idea.






#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


I don't think you can really join a community. You grow into it.

When more and more stuff got moved to Linux I started hanging out on some Linux IRC channels in ircnet. Later some OSS project channels got added to the list. And at some point I started packaging stuff I needed for my servers. The first 2 SuSE guys I met on IRC were mmj and daemon. I got invited to join the beta program and later started working directly at SuSE.






#### In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?


Helping people, especially with packaging and the buildservice. Advocating openSUSE. And [https://users.opensuse.org/](https://users.opensuse.org/).






#### What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?


Fun. And seeing the project evolving and growing.






#### What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you're most proud of?


[http://users.opensuse.org/](http://users.opensuse.org/)






#### When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?


Work time and when work needs to be done.






#### Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!


openSUSE is good for you.






#### What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?


More users could step up and be a real part of the project. Every single hand helps.






#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?


New opportunity and new challenges. Growing or shrinking to new platforms. Reaching new user groups.






#### A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?


Basically I would tell them "Give it a try. We are not as hyped as Ubuntu. But a good distro anyway."






#### Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?


Many people at SUSE. Benji, Francis, Pascal, and many people where I forgot the name.






#### How many icons are currently on your desktop?


None. Pekwm does not have any icons.






#### What is the application you can't live without? And why?


vim. It is the tool for most of my work.






#### Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?


No need to invent it. But Linux still needs a good filemanager.
Would be basically some porting work.






#### Which is your preferred text editor? And why?


vim. Fast. Configurable. I dont need more.






#### Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?


Can I get 100 active contributors instead of 1 famous person too? :)






#### Which computer related skills would you like to have?


Some language and parser theory.






#### The Internet crashes for a whole week ” how would you feel, what would you do?


Reading and sleeping. No internet. No work.






#### Which is your favorite movie scene?


The end of heroes. where you see all the arrows flying towards one man.






#### Star Trek or Star Wars?


Star Trek.






#### What is your favorite food and drink?


Corn flakes with milk without sugar.
Mate tea with mint or earl grey.






#### Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?


I played Tactical Ops from the first public beta until a few months ago.
Nowadays I waste my time with BF2142 and Eve.






#### Which city would you like to visit?


Stockholm, Oslo and maybe Vancouver.






#### What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?


Away from people so I can really chill. No phone. No handy. Nothing.






#### Someone gives you $1.000.000 ” what would you do with the money?


Building me a small house at the beach and for the rest of it I would sponsor projects I am interested in. (This include openSUSE of course)






#### If traveling through time was possible ” when would we be most likely to meet you?


Here and now.






#### There's a thunderstorm outside ” do you turn off your computer?


Uhm no? :)






#### Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?


Of course. :) Way too many times I guess.






#### Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!


Nothing here.






#### You couldn't live without...


My family. Music. Internet.






#### Which question was the hardest to answer?


Why a person should pick up openSUSE. I am no salesman.






#### What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?


None. We had enough questions already :p
