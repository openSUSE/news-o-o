As leader of the openSUSE Innovator initiative, openSUSE member and [official oneAPI innovator](https://devmesh.intel.com/users/alessandro-de-oliveira-faria), I tested the new release of the tool on openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.2 and Tumbleweed. With the total success of the work, I made available in the SDB an article on how to install this solution on the openSUSE platform. More information here: [https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install_oneAPI](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Install_oneAPI).


oneAPI is an Unified, Standards-Based Programming Model. Modern workload diversity necessitates the need for architectural diversity; no single architecture is best for every workload. XPUs, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators, are required to extract high performance.


This technology have the tools needed to deploy applications and solutions across these architectures. Its set of complementary toolkits—a base kit and specialty add-ons—simplify programming and help developers improve efficiency and innovation. The core Intel oneAPI DPC++ Compiler and libraries implement the oneAPI industry specifications available at [https://www.oneapi.com/open-source/](https://www.oneapi.com/open-source/). 

### Some features

**DPC++**: Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) is an open, standards-based evolution of ISO C++ that incorporates Khronos SYCL and community extensions to simplify data parallel programming.

**CUDA** Source Code Migration: The DPC++ Compatibility Tool is a migration engine that transforms CUDA code into a standards-based DPC++ code.

**AI**: Designed for end-to-end machine learning and data science pipelines, these toolkits are comprised of optimized Python *libraries and high-performance, deep learning frameworks and tools based on oneAPI libraries*.

Libraries : Powerful libraries—including deep learning, math, and video and media processing-are preoptimized for domain-specific functions and custom coded to accelerate compute-intense workloads.
