## GRUB2 with BLS is now in MicroOS and Tumbleweed

Recently the openSUSE project released for MicroOS and Tumbleweed a
new version of the GRUB2 package, with a new subpackage
`grub2-$ARCH-efi-bls`.  This subpackage deliver a new EFI file,
`grubbls.efi`, that can be used as replacement of the traditional
`grub.efi`.

The new PE binary is a version of GRUB2 that includes a set of patches
from Fedora, that makes the bootloader follows the boot loader
specification ([BLS](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/)).  This will make GRUB2 understand the boot
entries from `/boot/efi/entries`, and dynamically generate the boot
menu showed during boot time.

This is really important for full disk encryption (FDE), because this
means that now we can re-use all the architecture and tools designed
for `systemd-boot`.  For example, installing or updating the boot
loader can now be done with `sdbootutil install`, the
`suse-module-tools` scriptlets will create new BLS entries when a new
kernel is installed, and the `tukit` and `snapper` plugins will take
care of doing the right thing when snapshots are created or removed.

Reusing all those tools without change was a great win, but what is
better is that some of the quirks that the classical GRUB2 presented
when extending the event log are not present anymore.  Before this
package, `sdbootutil` needed to take ownership of the `grub.conf`
file, as this will be measured by GRUB2 *by executed lines*.  That is
right, for each line that is read and executed by the GRUB2 parser, a
new PCR#8 will take place, and because GRUB2 support conditional as
other complex constructors, it is very hard to predict the final value
of PCR#8 without imposing a very minimal and strict `grub.conf`.

But with the new BLS subpackage this file, together with the fonts and
graphical assets for the theme, and the required modules (like
`bli.mod`) are now included in the internal `squashfs` inside the EFI
binary.  GRUB2 will not measure those internal files, without
decreasing the security guarantees, because is now the firmware the
one that measures the full EFI when the bootloader is executed during
the boot process.

As today we cannot use YaST2 to install GRUB2 with BLS, but we can do
that manually very easily.  We need to make a `systemd-boot`
[installation](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/FDE#Installation_with_YaST), replace `LOADER_TYPE` from `systemd-boot` to
`grub2-bls`, install the new GRUB2 BLS package, and do `sdbootutil
install`.  Another option is to play with one of the available images
for [MicroOS](https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/appliances/openSUSE-MicroOS.x86_64-kvm-and-xen-grub-bls.qcow2) or [Tumbleweed]( https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/appliances/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Minimal-VM.x86_64-kvm-and-xen-grub-bls.qcow2).
