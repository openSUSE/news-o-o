This is a roundup of articles from the openSUSE community listed on [planet.opensuse.org](https://planet.opensuse.org). 


The below featured highlights listed on the community’s blog feed aggregator are from November 1 to 6. 


Blog posts this week highlight a post-mortem with the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/), a Tenerife LanParty, a security issue announcement by [SUSE Security Team](https://security.opensuse.org), Quantum computing in open source and much more.


**Here is a summary and links for each post:**


## [Hack Week Project Aims to Rebuild Classic Games](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/11/06/hw-project-aims-to-rebuild-classic-games/)
Hack Week 25 is Dec. 1 - 5 and it has a project that is reverse-engineering 1990s PC games like Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares, Chaos Overlords and others to build clean versions capable of running the game. The goal is to have playable prototypes built during the week. 

## [Third update of KDE Gear 25.08](https://www.kdeblog.com/tercera-actualizacion-de-kde-%e2%9a%99%ef%b8%8f-gear-25-08.html)
The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) highlights the third update of Gear 25.08 and introduces several bug-fixes across apps, libraries and widgets to improve stability and translations for Konqi users.

## [scx: Unauthenticated scx_loader D-Bus Service can lead to major Denial-of-Service](https://security.opensuse.org/2025/11/06/scx-unauthorized-dbus.html)
Posts like this don’t happen too often, but this [SUSE Security Team Blog](https://security.opensuse.org) should get people’s attention. This security blog post highlights scx project’s `scx_loader`. The D-Bus service could run with root privileges and no authentication, which could allow any unprivileged user to manipulate system schedulers and potentially cause a denial-of-service.

## [Severe Service Degradation: OBS Unreliable/Unavailable](https://openbuildservice.org/2025/11/05/post-mortem/)
The Open Build Service team published a service post-mortem discussing recent operational issues and outlining improvements to monitoring and response workflows. Lessons learned from the post-mortem are that the team set sensible limits for build service requests (and possibly other areas) as serving all results at once for a request with 6,000+ actions is unsustainable. 

## [Plasma 6.5 Second Update](https://www.kdeblog.com/segunda-actualizacion-de-plasma-6-5.html)
The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) and Plasma 6.5 team released its second update for the desktop environment on Nov. 4. It focuses on improving stability, better translations and bug fixes. A couple fixes included having a smoother automatic shift between light and dark themes and enhancing global WiFi password storage.

## [Compilation of the Free Software Foundation newsletter – November 2025](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/2025/11/04/recopilacion-del-boletin-de-noticias-de-la-free-software-foundation-noviembre-de-2025/)

From tracking aircraft with SDR to deploying Kubernetes clusters, [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) can be used to learn through experimentation on a stable, production-grade base.

## [Quantum computing and open source: the future is already in open source on Compilando Podcast](https://www.kdeblog.com/computacion-cuantica-y-open-source-el-futuro-ya-esta-en-codigo-abierto-en-compilando-podcast.html)
The hosts dive into the world of quantum computing during this episode of the Compilando Podcast. What qubits are? Why do ultra-cold conditions matter?
