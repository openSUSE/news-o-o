A decade has passed since Yogyakarta proudly hosted the first openSUSE.Asia Summit in Indonesia — and in 2026, we are returning to where the excitement first flourished.

Indonesia has a special place in the history of the summit:

- In 2016, Indonesia hosted its first openSUSE.Asia Summit in Yogyakarta
- In 2019, the summit was successfully held again in Bali, offering a memorable community celebration

We are thrilled to announce that the openSUSE.Asia Summit 2026 will take place in Yogyakarta, the cultural heartbeat of Indonesia. The summit is an annual gathering for openSUSE users, contributors, and FLOSS enthusiasts from across the region. It serves as a platform for collaboration, learning, and sharing experiences about openSUSE and the broader open-source ecosystem.

Yogyakarta, often called the City of Students, is home to dozens of universities and vibrant tech communities. Its young talent and strong academic environment foster innovation and open-source adoption. Beyond education and technology, Yogyakarta is also a living center of heritage — with its royal palace, traditional arts, and world-renowned landmarks such as the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan located nearby. The charm of its cultural richness blends seamlessly with modern creativity and digital progress.

Visitors will not only participate in inspiring sessions, workshops, and community activities — but also experience warm local hospitality, unique cuisine, and a rich artistic atmosphere that makes Yogyakarta unforgettable.

The summit is expected to take place on 3–4 October 2026. Call for speakers is planned to close by the end of June 2026. More information, including venue details, will follow soon — stay tuned for upcoming announcements!

We look forward to welcoming you to Yogyakarta and celebrating openSUSE together once again.
See you in Indonesia! 🦎🌏
