As the founder of the  [openSUSE Innovator initiative](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:INNOVATORS), and a member of the openSUSE and Intel Innovator communities, I maintain my ongoing commitment to bringing cutting-edge technologies to the different flavors of the openSUSE Linux distribution.

With the arrival of NPU (Neural Processing Unit) devices, it has become possible to run LLMs and generative AI applications without relying on a dedicated GPU. In light of this advancement, we began the work of packaging the Intel NPU Driver into RPM for the openSUSE ecosystem. As a result of this collective effort, the openSUSE for Innovators initiative is proud to announce the official availability of this package to the community.

The Intel NPU is an inference accelerator integrated into Intel CPUs starting with the Intel® Core™ Ultra family (formerly known as Meteor Lake). It enables efficient and low-power execution of artificial neural network workloads directly on the processor.

The NPU is integrated into the processor die, designed to perform matrix operations of neural networks with high energy efficiency. Its architecture complements CPU and GPU, enabling intelligent offloading for ONNX models, computer vision pipelines, quantized models, and hybrid model operations with simultaneous use of CPU+GPU+NPU.

Participating in this project is a source of great satisfaction, as we know it will have a significant impact on future applications. As members of an open-source community, we have a responsibility to democratize emerging technologies and help reduce the digital divide, and this delivery is another important step in that direction.
