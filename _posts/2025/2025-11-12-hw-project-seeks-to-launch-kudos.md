A new [Hack Week 25](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) project  aims to display appreciation and recognition for contributors across the openSUSE Project.

Called [Kudos](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos), the application is designed to give members of the project an easy way to acknowledge contributions beyond code submissions alone.

Lubos Kocman joked during the naming discussion that "We also had an option to call it ReKognize and have a [Mortal Kombat announcer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z3rwvB8drJPfm9MCQTVRQvUr3C0Q6UMs) behind the menu items."

[Kudos](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/25/projects/kudos-aka-opensuse-recognition-platform) began shortly after the release of [Leap 16.0](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/) with the goal of creating a simple and friendly way for community members to thank one another for their efforts and contributions. 

As a Release Manager, Kocman and other release managers have long recognized core Leap contributors after each release. 

"We used to send people Leap DVD boxes," he said, but these DVDs are no longer produces. 

An internal SUSE recognition platform allows for employees to acknowledge one another since DVDs were no longer an option. Kocman began sending emails [mimicing](https://github.com/openSUSE/artwork/tree/master/recognition)  SUSE's recognition messages. 

"But at some point I was fed up and thought to myself, we can do better," Kocman said, who created the [Kudos](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos) [Hack Week project](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/25/projects/kudos-aka-opensuse-recognition-platform).

He notes that openSUSE relies on extensive, often invisible efforts. These include contributions with translations, documentation updates, wiki curation, infrastructure maintenance, moderation, booth staffing, testing, talks, and countless other efforts that rarely show up in a traditional form of recongition.

Kudos aims to bring those contributions into the light.

The visablity of these recogniztion will take place in areas where members of the project communicate. Sharing could take place on [chat.opensuse.org](https://chat.opensuse.org), on social media through bots, Slack, and other options, which will be explored during Hack Week and beyond.

[Kudos](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos) resources include the application’s source code, a dedicated badge repository, and an issue tracker. Existing badge templates can be used, but the maintainer asks participants not to create new badge requests during Hack Week unless they also plan to complete them during the event.

Developers and contributors interested in participating can join or follow the project’s progress through the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos).

Hack Week, which began in 2007, has become a cornerstone of the project’s open-source culture. Hack Week has produced tools that are now integral to the openSUSE ecosystem, such as [openQA](https://open.qa/), [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) and [Aeon Desktop](https://aeondesktop.github.io/). Hack Week has also seeded projects that later grew into widely used products; the origins of [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) and its fork [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) derive from a Hack Week project started more than a decade ago.
