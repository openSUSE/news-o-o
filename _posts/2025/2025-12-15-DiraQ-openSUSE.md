It is with great joy that I officially announce the launch of [DiraQ](https://en.opensuse.org/User:Cabelo/DiraQ), a portable Linux distribution based on openSUSE Leap 15.6 (16.0 coming soon) designed especially for experimentation, teaching, and research in quantum computing. DiraQ runs directly from a USB drive, without the need to modify the computer's hard drive.

The idea for the project arose from the observation that many students, researchers, and enthusiasts of quantum computing encounter infrastructure barriers: setting up complex environments, installing specific libraries, dealing with incompatibilities, etc. DiraQ emerges as a practical and "plug-and-play" alternative, allowing a complete environment for quantum experimentation to be launched on any compatible computer with just a USB drive.

Furthermore, DiraQ is closely linked to the LEONTI project: Brazil's first open-source photonic quantum computer—acting as its official operating system. This means that DiraQ goes beyond being "just another distribution"; it functions as a bridge between photonic quantum hardware and the world of classical software.

### Main highlights

* Pre-configured environment with cutting-edge quantum libraries and frameworks, such as Cirq , PennyLane, Qiskit, Perceval, and Strawberry Fields .
* Robust and portable: simply burn the image to a USB drive and boot up any compatible machine without touching the rest of the installed operating system.
* In the future, it will have high-level API integration for communication between the DiraQ/LEONTI and external applications, whether via Wi-Fi or physical connections such as USB.
* Open licensing and a collaborative spirit: the project is designed so that the community participates, contributes, and builds this ecosystem together.


DiraQ was conceived by Wilson Fonseca and [Alessandro “Cabelo” de Oliveira Faria](https://en.opensuse.org/User:Cabelo), but for it to reach its true potential, it is essential that the scientific community, enthusiasts, and developers participate.

If you are proficient in Python, want to test quantum frameworks, or help with documentation, you have a guaranteed place in this project. We want to make quantum computing more accessible, and together we can build a global, open, and robust platform for education.
