This is a roundup of articles from the openSUSE community listed on [planet.opensuse.org](https://planet.opensuse.org). 


The below featured highlights listed on the community’s blog feed aggregator are from November 22 to 28. 


Blog posts this week highlight a broad mix of desktop improvements, community efforts, and privacy awareness. KDE Plasma sees notable progress in accessibility and [KDE](https://kde.org/) also launches its 2025 fundraising campaign while some prepare for a major open-source seminar. Elsewhere, there’s hands-on Linux hardware coverage with Intel NPU drivers, packaging guidance for RPM maintainers, an openSUSE [Hack Week](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/) aiming to improve membership workflows, and sharp commentary on user privacy as well as concerns about Smart TV terms-of-service.


**Here is a summary and links for each post:**


## [Most of the access to Plasma 6.5](https://www.kdeblog.com/las-mejoras-en-la-accesibilidad-de-plasma-6-5.html)  
KDE Blog outlines accessibility improvements in Plasma 6.5 aimed at making the desktop more usable for visually or hearing-impaired users. Screen readers like Orca can now announce Caps Lock status and better describe keyboard shortcuts. Additional enhancements include flicker-free rendering to reduce photosensitivity risk, improved overall keyboard navigation across Plasma and more.  


## [rpm premable – order matters](https://nordisch.org/posts/rpm-preamble-order-matters/)  
[Nordisch](https://nordisch.org) explains a build issue encountered when packaging PostgreSQL extensions: macros like `%{version}` and `%{release}` remained unexpanded because they were defined after references to them in the preamble. The post serves as a reminder to maintain a consistent spec-file header order to avoid subtle build errors.  


## [Help us reach the tipping point!: Fundraising campaign for KDE 2025](https://www.kdeblog.com/ayudanos-a-alcanzar-el-punto-de-inflexion-campana-de-recaudacion-para-kde-2025.html)  
The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) calls for donations to support the 2025 fundraising drive under the slogan “Help us reach the inflection point,” stressing that much of KDE’s funding comes from private supporters. The funds will help maintain servers, support developer sprints and events like conferences. Users are invited to “adopt” a KDE application by [donating](https://kde.org/fundraisers/plasma6member/) and publicly showing their support.  


## [Hack Week Project Takes Aim at Improving Membership Management](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/11/26/hw-project-takes-aim-improving-membership/)  
The post announces a Hack Week 25 project called openSUSE Lounge, which is a new platform aiming to centralize and simplify membership management for openSUSE. openSUSE Lounge aims to maintain member records, track membership status, support election tasks, and ease the workload for membership and election officials.  


## [Black Friday 2025 de Slimbook](https://www.kdeblog.com/black-friday-2025-de-slimbook.html)  
The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) announces real Black Friday discounts on Slimbook laptops and desktops. Saving range from ~ €30 to €150 depending on the model. The post also invites the community to join the #KDEslimbook social campaign and to show off their Plasma setups to win merchandise and celebrate Linux-ready hardware.  


## [Installing Intel NPU Driver on Linux](https://assuntonerd.com.br/2025/11/26/instalando-intel-npu-driver-no-linux/)  
The blog explains how to install the Intel NPU Driver on Linux while enabling support for the NPU (neural processing unit) present in modern Intel Core Ultra CPUs. The post outlines that the driver stack consists of a kernel module (intel_vpu) and a user-space stack including a compiler, Level Zero runtime and firmware.  


## [GrapheneOS migrates its servers out of France amid pressure and legal threats](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/2025/11/25/grapheneos-migra-sus-servidores-fuera-de-francia-por/)  
[Victorhck](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/) reports that GrapheneOS has decided to move all its website, forum and social-media servers from France to foreign hosts due to legal pressure, which appear to be hostile toward open-source privacy projects. Hosting will shift from the French provider OVHCloud to a mix of servers in Toronto and Germany.  


## [KDE Express Episode 58: Building Community with Paco Estrada](https://www.kdeblog.com/episodio-58-de-kde-express-compilando-comunidad-con-paco-estrada.html)  
This episode of KDE Express welcomes back podcaster Paco Estrada to discuss his return to producing regular episodes about GNU/Linux and free-software. The conversation reviews his plans for 2026 and reflects on the role of community podcasts in the free-software ecosystem.  


## [I read the terms of service for my Smart TV and now I sleep with one eye open](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/2025/11/24/lei-los-terminos-del-servicio-de-mi-smart-tv-y-ahora-duermo-con-un-ojo-abierto/)  
[Victorhck](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/) recounts reading the “terms of service” for his new Smart TV and realizes its written as a consent to constant surveillance. The clauses grant the manufacturer rights to record video, listen to audio, collect usage data, push mandatory firmware updates, and even treat the TV as licensed (not sold), undermining user autonomy.


## [KDE will be present at the 4th Annual Opensource Seminar](https://www.kdeblog.com/kde-estara-presente-en-el-iv-seminario-anual-opensource.html)  
The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) announces that the community will participate in the “IV Seminario Anual Opensource”, which is an online event covering GNU/Linux, system administration, server setups, and security topics. The event is Nov. 29 at 21:00 CET.  


## [User interface and performance improvements – This week in Plasma](https://www.kdeblog.com/mejoras-en-la-interfaz-de-usuarios-y-el-rendimiento-esta-semana-en-plasma.html)  
KDE’s weekly update reports a batch of UI and performance improvements in KDE Plasma aimed for the upcoming 6.6.0 release. Users can now choose to exclude specific windows from screen recordings, blur effects in dark mode are more refined (and can have customizable saturation), and task-switching order when using grouped icons now respects most-recent use rather than always prioritizing full-screen windows.
