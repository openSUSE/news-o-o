The openSUSE community will celebrate the 6-year anniversary of the [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) on Dec. 19 starting at 13:00 UTC. Join people in the bar and celebrate this social space where open-source enthusiasts, developers and like-minded people come together to discuss open source and more.

The [openSUSE Bar](https://meet.opensuse.org/bar) has become more than just a meeting place over the years; it’s a space to collaborate, connect and enjoy a welcoming atmosphere for sharing ideas and tech knowledge. The bar has hosted countless informal meetups and networking moments, celebrated openSUSE milestones, and serves as a familiar gathering point for openSUSE fans across the globe.

Community members are invited to join the celebration and share memories or stories of experiences as a part of the project.

Those interested in the origins of the openSUSE Bar can watch a [video about the beginning of the openSUSE Bar](https://youtu.be/YmnawYltDSQ?si=mjH9oJGM3wxgnUfq) from a talk at [openSUSE Conference](https://events.opensuse.org/) 2022.
