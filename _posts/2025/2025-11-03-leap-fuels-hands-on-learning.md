Lifelong learners and tech enthusiasts don’t view [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) as just a stable operating system, but a [launchpad for discovery](https://forums.opensuse.org/t/november-2025-screenshots/189478). 

Malcolm, who shared with the [openSUSE community](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/) how his setup is helping to track aviation through the Mississippi Delta with [FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/) and [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/),  sees more use cases for Leap like turning a home lab into a personal academy for cloud-native systems and beyond.

Malcolm uses software-defined radio (SDR) tools that let users decode real-time transmissions. Using an [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) dongle connected to his Leap-powered systems, Malcolm can track far more than aircraft as SDR can be used to tune into a wide range of radio frequencies. Leap supports a wide variety of open-source software packages and this makes it easy to install and run software for radio signals, [satellite data, and more](use link to edwin's article).

Whether experimenting with SDR, or working with satellite data, Leap 16 provides a stable and secure foundation for experimenting. 

People learn about container orchestration with Leap.

Tools like KVM or [Boxes](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.gnome.Boxes) on openSUSE can create virtual clusters to simulate multi-server environments. People can use [openSUSE images](https://get.opensuse.org/) to explore the Kubernetes ecosystem. With [k3s](https://k3s.io/), [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/), [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) and [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) on openSUSE,  people can train for certifications and build their skills. This prepares people to learn hands-on troubleshooting and managing cloud production environments.

With Leap 16 and [Leap Micro 6.2](https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro/), users can expand technical knowledge, experiment with new software stacks, and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. Experimenting with projects helps in the development of core technical skills like those involved with networking, scripting and system tuning; these learned skills open doors for [STEM education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) and DevOps training.

Stories like this highlight a common overlooked use case; continuous learning! A community platform like openSUSE enables learners to experiment, fail, and try again. Students, hobbyists, and professionals alike can build, break, and rebuild systems using Leap with confidence. Whether you’re tracking a balloon over the stratosphere or deploying your first [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster, openSUSE Leap provides a foundation for learning by doing.

Members of the openSUSE Project are trying to showcase how people use openSUSE . If you have a  use cases for Leap 16 that you want to share, comment on the [project’s mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/6EL3OTP7V7EKS5QZ35U6SSHY4Y6GCYJ7/).

Leap is built using the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLE) sources and binaries. Its enterprise-grade stability sets it apart from typical community Linux distros. Leap 16.0 has an extended 24-month support period.
