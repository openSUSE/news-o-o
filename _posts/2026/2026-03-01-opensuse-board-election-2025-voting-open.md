**Voting for the 2025 openSUSE Board election starts today.**

All [openSUSE Members](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members) have the right to vote and should have received their personal ballot link by email yesterday. Please check your inbox (and your spam folder, just in case) and take a few minutes to cast your vote.

This year we are electing **two Board seats**, currently held by Simon Lees and Shawn W Dunn. Both Simon and Shawn have stepped forward and are seeking re-election. Joining them on the ballot are Ihno Krumreich and Soc Virnyl Estela.

Voting is open from **March 1 until March 8**, and we plan to announce the results on **March 9**.

Full details about the election process can be found [here](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election).

Although voting is taking place in 2026, this is officially the 2025 openSUSE Board Election due to a delayed start of the election cycle.

## Meet the Candidates


Four members of our community have stepped forward to stand for election this year.

*From left to right on the [top picture](http://localhost:4000/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/board-election-2025-candidates.png): Shawn W Dunn, Simon Lees, Soc Virnyl Estela, Ihno Krumreich.*

In addition to their individual platforms, Luboš Kocman asked all candidates two questions:

*1. What is your opinion on [the new governance proposal](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/YKI5QVMT66WMZLOPTCQOEQZPTEWPDIBV/) initiated by Jeff Mahoney, and how can the project help ensure the success of the proposed committees?*

*2. Do you plan to attend [openSUSE Conference 2026]((https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC26)) in person?*


Below is a short overview of each candidate, along with links to their platforms and responses.

### Ihno Krumreich (bigiron)

Ihno was nominated by Sarah Julia Kriesch, who described him as a knowledgeable and trusted member of the openSUSE community and part of the openSUSE zSystems Team. She highlighted his openness, experience, and ability to act as a bridge between SUSE and the broader openSUSE community.

The nomination can be read [here](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/project@lists.opensuse.org/thread/M6NKT23UQ7JECQDD3AJMDO3UUHYF5TYP/).

Ihno recently retired after 25 years at SUSE, where he worked for more than 22 years as Project Manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for System z. His long experience with enterprise Linux and large-scale development brings deep historical and organizational insight to the project.
