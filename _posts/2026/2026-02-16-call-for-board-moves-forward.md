The [openSUSE Project[(https://www.opensuse.org/) has opened nominations for its regular [Board Election](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election) and voting is scheduled to begin March 1.

After a delay to clean up the membership database, the Election Committee confirmed the process is back on track. Project members will choose candidates to fill two open seats on the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board). 

The two open seats are those currently filled by Shawn W. Dunn and Simon Lees.

The call is open to all eligible openSUSE members interested in helping guide the project’s community, governance and external representation. Serving on the Board offers a direct opportunity to shape how openSUSE resolves issues, supports contributors and represents itself within the open-source community.

Nominations and self-applications are open through Feb. 28. Candidates must be current openSUSE members.

Voting is scheduled to begin March 1 and close March 8. Results are expected to be announced March 9.

Members who wish to run should email <project@lists.opensuse.org> and <election-officials@lists.opensuse.org> with their name, registered email address and openSUSE username.

The Election Committee encouraged members to step forward. The project depends on community members willing to lead, listen and represent the project’s shared values.

A [recent article](https://news.opensuse.org/2026/02/12/board-interview-participation-gov-community/) provides recommendations to assist candidates in preparing to run for the openSUSE Board and can be found on [news.opensuse.org.](https://news.opensuse.org/2026/02/12/board-interview-participation-gov-community/)
