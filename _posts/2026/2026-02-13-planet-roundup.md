This is a roundup of articles from the openSUSE community listed on [planet.opensuse.org](https://planet.opensuse.org).


The community blog feed aggregator lists the featured highlights below from Feb. 6 to 12.


Blogs this week highlight a reflective moment for the Linux ecosystem alongside practical tools for everyday use and a landmark Spanish Supreme Court ruling. Blogs also highlight the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board) members’ roles within the project and [AudioTube](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.kde.audiotube) emerging as a lightweight, privacy-conscious solution for streaming YouTube music directly on the Linux desktop. Other blogs focus on progress within the KDE ecosystem, which includes blogs about Plasma 6.6 and KDE’s immutable Linux distribution. 


**Here is a summary and links for each post:**


## [openSUSE Board on Participation, Governance and Community – Interview with Board Members](https://news.opensuse.org/2026/02/12/board-interview-participation-gov-community/)
A [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org) post features an interview with current openSUSE Board members Ish Sookun, Jeff Mahoney and Rachel Schrader about the Board’s role, responsibilities, and motivations as the 2026 elections approach.

## [Progress Summary for KDE Linux: The Operating System of the Future Is Now 62 Percent Complete](https://www.kdeblog.com/resumen-del-progreso-en-kde-linux-el-sistema-operativo-del-futuro-ya-esta-al-62.html)


The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) reports that KDE’s official immutable operating system is under development by the KDE community and has reached approximately 62 percent completion. The distribution features an immutable base architecture with atomic A/B image updates powered by systemd, automatic Btrfs snapshots, and application delivery exclusively through Flatpak, Snap, or AppImages rather than traditional package management. It’s similar to openSUSE’s [Kalpa Desktop](https://kalpadesktop.org/).


## [The Big Problem of Linux – Video](https://www.kdeblog.com/el-gran-problema-de-linux-video.html)


The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) shares a thought-provoking video titled "The Big Problem of Linux", which examines challenges facing the Linux ecosystem and reflects on the evolution of Free Software. The video encourages viewers to consider both the progress made by open source communities and the persistent hurdles that limit wider adoption. The video argues that the issue isn’t technical but lies in perception such as a “hacker” stigma and outdated narratives about usability, which can alienate adoption. 


## [Episode 13 of Accessibility with Free Technologies – Returning in 2025 with 5 Sections and an Interview](https://www.kdeblog.com/episodio-13-de-accesibilidad-con-tecnologias-libres-volvemos-en-2025-con-5-secciones-y-1-entrevista.html)

## [Legal Precedent in Spain: Software Access as a Guarantee of Real Democracy](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/2026/02/09/precedente-legal-en-espana-el-acceso-al-software-como-garantia-de-una-democracia-real/)


A blog by [victorhck](https://victorhckinthefreeworld.com/) examines a landmark Spanish Supreme Court ruling establishing that the freedom to study source code is constitutionally necessary for democratic oversight of public administration algorithms. The precedent affirms citizens' right to access and examine software used in government decision-making processes, reinforcing transparency as a fundamental democratic safeguard. This ruling strengthens the legal foundation for open-source software advocacy in Spain.

The [KDE Blog](https://www.kdeblog.com/) introduces AudioTube, a lightweight Qt-based application that lets users stream music directly from YouTube without opening a web browser. The app features a clean interface with search functionality, playlist support, and background playback capabilities while respecting YouTube's terms of service. AudioTube is available in repositories and as a [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.kde.audiotube). It offers a privacy-focused alternative to web-based YouTube music consumption on the Linux desktop.
