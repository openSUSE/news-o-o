#### Please introduce yourself!


To plagiarize my own site; “I am just a guy with a passion for the outdoors, photography, technology, and in general, shiny things with blinking lights.” My greatest passion has to be mountain biking, however there are many sources of adrenaline I have yet to explore, so that is subject to change.

I JUST (Feb 5) turned 27, which I am less than stoked about. I am currently located in the foothills of North Carolina, USA, where I work as a web developer and I.T. specialist. I want very badly to travel the world, but do not have the means just yet. Pets? Sure, I love pets.... until they attack!






#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


My family got their first computer when I was ~10, I believe it was a 286. A couple of years later I received a 486 DX2 66Mhz Packard Bell as a gift from my grandfather. It was the first computer that I really got to know well. It was certainly the start of my lust for technology.

From there I believe it was largely gaming and a general curiosity about how technology works that motivated me to keep learning more about computers. Currently, I am as passionate as ever about technology and cannot wait to see what the future brings.






#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


I began using SuSE Linux just after 9.2 became freely available for download, which was roughly 3 months after it's official release, almost 4 years ago now.

I had become increasingly annoyed with the amount of time I was spending on defensive measures (anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-rootkit, etc). Furthermore, I was terribly bored by both supporting and more acutely, using Windows. Having tried several flavors of Linux numerous times in the past, I figured it was time to see if I could use a Linux distro as my primary desktop once again.

I went with SuSE on that fateful day only because I had not tried it before and they had just had a release which seemed to have a positive buzz. Everything worked in an intuitive way for me and then I discovered YaST, Quanta, and Amarok. The rest is history.






#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


I would say I joined the community within hours of becoming a SuSE user. Having used IRC extensively since I was ~12 or 13 years old, it seemed like the natural place to look for help. In #SuSE I found a great community of people with a wide variety of skills willing to help new users adjust.

Once I had adjusted to SuSE myself, I noticed other users asking the same questions I had just learned the answers to. So... I began helping people where I could, learning more myself as I went.






#### In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?


After using SuSE as my primary desktop for about a year I began writing some basic how-to articles to help new users adjust, install software, configure various services, etc... I don't see the need to do this any more with the openSUSE wiki.

I also submit bug reports, help out with web development where I can, and harass the developers.

My main participation in the project consists off supporting users on IRC, and advocating openSUSE usage to anyone that is silly enough to ask me what I think with out a clear exit strategy.






#### What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?


The main reason I participate in project in general would have to be for all the ladies!

But my greatest motivation for participating on IRC, is definitely when I see people I helped as new users, months or even years ago, helping others.






#### What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you're most proud of?


Well based on the feed back I received, I think an article I wrote about using Smart on openSUSE 10.1 to get around the horrific package management issues of yore, was my most helpful single contribution. A few people even told me it kept them from switching distros. Yay!






#### When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?


When I should be working.






#### Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!


Best KDE Distro!






#### What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?


Missing: task-oriented multi-lingual screencasts to demonstrate YaST and KDE desktop usage, web server setup, etc..

Underrated: The ease of use and the awesomeness of YaST. As a new Linux user, YaST is just the best thing ever.






#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?


The same thing that I hope it holds for me: wealth, prosperity, and a sporty brunette with a wild streak and a trust fund.






#### A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?


First, I'd tell them the benefits of Linux and its ethos as well as the awesomeness of YaST and openSUSE KDE. Then I'd tell them that for every other distribution/OS they use, the God of their choice and one of mine KICKS a puppy.






#### Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?


None unfortunately, I had so wanted to goto FOSDEM this year but it did not work out. I'm hoping I'll be able to make it next year instead.






#### How many icons are currently on your desktop?


2, a trash can and a shredder.






#### What is the application you can't live without? And why?


[Quanta](%E2%80%9D//quanta.kdewebdev.org/), because I can't make a living with out it.






#### Which application or feature should be invented as soon as possible?


Marking menus(ala Alias Wavefront Maya) for Krita! Hard to explain, but roughly:

#### Which is your preferred text editor? And why?


[Quanta](//quanta.kdewebdev.org/), great Qt ui that gets almost 100% out of sight, powerful tools for working with php code, debugger integration, kdesvn integration.






#### Which famous person would you want to join the openSUSE community?


Oprah, whatever that women touches turns to gold.






#### Which computer related skills would you like to have?


C++/Qt Programmer (so I could contribute code to KDE).






#### The Internet crashes for a whole week — how would you feel, what would you do?


I'd feel like it would be a good time for a week long hiking trip or perhaps a very long bike ride.






#### Which is your favorite movie scene?


I gotta go with battle of Helm's Deep from Lord of the Rings.






#### Star Trek or Star Wars?


If you are going to force me to choose, Star Wars!






#### What is your favorite food and drink?


Donuts and the Blue Raspberry Gatorade.






#### Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?


As a kid I was a big Nintendo fan but once I got a computer there was no going back. Although I'm actually going to buy a Xbox 360 just for Grand Theft Auto 4 (I can't wait a year for the PC version)!






#### Which city would you like to visit?


Any city that has a fellow openSUSE user to show me all the cool stuff that only locals know about.






#### What is your preferred way to spend your vacation?


On a mountain bike at top speed or taking pictures of nature.






#### Someone gives you $1.000.000 — what would you do with the money?


Easy. Travel the world with a close friend, a camera, and a need to experience every sport, hunt, and adrenaline inducing activity known to man! After that, who knows... what's a stripped down old Soviet Mig run these days?






#### If traveling through time was possible — when would we be most likely to meet you?


Sure I could change the course of all mankind, but you'd most likely find me telling past-me about all the opportunities he is missing and the mistakes he is about to make.






#### There's a thunderstorm outside — do you turn off your computer?


No, but I should.






#### Have your ever missed an appointment because you forgot about it while sitting at your computer?


Who says I forgot.






#### Show us a picture of something, you have always wanted to share!


[![Yonalasee Wallpaper](//spinink.net/images/screens/yonalasee-3.jpg)](//spinink.net/gallery/view/wallpapers/dualwidescreen/yonalasee-3.jpg.html)

I shoot panoramic photography and make [dual screen wallpapers](//spinink.net/gallery/view/wallpapers/dualwidescreen) from them.






#### You couldn't live without...


My mountain bike.






#### Which question was the hardest to answer?


The motto question.






#### What other question would you like to answer? And what would you answer?


What does your desktop look like?
