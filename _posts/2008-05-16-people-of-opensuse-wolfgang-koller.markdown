#### Please introduce yourself!


I was born on the 11th February 1985, which means I'm 23 right now! I was born in Vienna and I still live here. I'm a self-employed IT-Engineer, however in addition I study physics at the Vienna university of Technology. I live together with my girlfriend, no children yet.






#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


I started using computers at the age of maybe 11 (not to sure anymore), my dad brought home an old 286 from his work and so it all started. I was always interested into how computers work and designing programs for it. So that's why I started programming in QBasic first. However I quickly moved to C / C++ which I'm still using often today (most of the time for Linux of course :) ).

Over the years I learned around 20 coding languages, however most of them are useless today.

Of course I also love to play games on the computer, including MMORPGs and Shooters.






#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


My first SuSE Version was 6.2, which gave me my uncle (who always had a major influence on my interest for computers). However I quickly discovered that I wasn't ready for it. I still tried several SuSE version until 7.3 which I then used regularly. From that day I always had a Linux installed and nowadays for working I only use Linux anymore, Windows is just there for gaming!






#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


I actually can't remember the exact date, however I actually started a "support" site for SuSE Linux when I started learning things myself. I published several HowTos there whenever I discovered something new and in addition I added a forum.






#### In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?


I'm an admin and founder of [suselinuxsupport.de](http://www.suselinuxsupport.de), which I'm still working on.

In addition I'm writing some programs for KDE, including KTrafficAnalyzer and KCDemu (which are not limited to openSUSE, thought).






#### What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?


I was always a fan of the idea to give everybody the possibility to use software for as many applications as they need them. In addition I discovered that you can meet many nice and friendly people who share the same thoughts.






#### What do you think was your most important contribution to the openSUSE project/community or what is the contribution that you're most proud of?


The [suselinuxsupport.de](http://www.suselinuxsupport.de) community - although that's not really my work but rather I'm just providing the server for it (the rest is done by the community, obviously) :) !






#### When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?


Whenever I find time for it. I always try to check the forums a few times a day. The programs I'm working on are updated every few months. So as I said, whenever I have time for it :) !






#### Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!


Nothing is better than the freedom to make a choice.






#### What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?

#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project?


Sex, Drugs and Rock'N'Roll - oh wait wrong topic :) !
