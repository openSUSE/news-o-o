#### Please introduce yourself!


My name is Manu, I am 21 years old and I live in India. I am currently in my final year of graduation in computer science. My native language is Hindi. During my free time, I participate in openSUSE Project and hang out with friends, watch movies and do other stuff.


#### Tell us about the background to your computer use.


I started with computers in my 6th standard I believe starting with computer games. I immediately fell in love with them. But as I moved to boarding I had no access to computers until my college.


#### When and why did you start using openSUSE/SUSE Linux?


I started using openSUSE around 2 years back. I started to use it out of fascination and to learn about Linux as much as I can. Earlier I used Ubuntu and Fedora too but openSUSE caught my attention. I realized it to be a wonderful operating system that furnished my needs.


#### When did you join the openSUSE community and what made you do that?


The same time I started using openSUSE. One prominent reason was to learn Linux. So I joined the community  to meet awesome people and learn from them.
**In what way do you participate in the openSUSE project?**

I participate in the openSUSE Project in a lot of ways. I am a part of the marketing team, the news team and also the part of ambassador welcome team in our ambassador programme. With my GSoC Project, I will be working on SaX3 and I hope to do it justice.


#### What especially motivates you to participate in the openSUSE project?


The fun element and the awesomest people in the project.


#### Tell us about your GSoC project?


I am working on SaX3, and off course it needs no introduction. I just hope I do justice to it at the end of the coding period.


#### When do you usually spend time on the openSUSE project?


I usually spend a lot of my free time for openSUSE.


#### Three words to describe openSUSE? Or make up a proper slogan!


Have a lot of fun :)


#### What do you think is missing or underrated in the distribution or the project?


We need a tighter integration with media codecs. Rest all works like a charm.


#### What do you think the future holds for the openSUSE project? And your future at the project?


openSUSE has got a wonderful future. I donâ€™t know about my future at the project but definitely like to keep it the way as it is now.


#### A person asks you why he/she should choose openSUSE instead of other distribution/OS. What would be your arguments to convince him/her to pick up openSUSE?


I will ask them to use it for at least 2 months and explore it and then decide. People want instant results and that is not achievable.


#### Which members of the openSUSE community have you met in person?


Sankar P, Vincent Untz, Bharath Acaharya, Akhil Ladha and a lot of the people from SUSE / Novell Bangalore (now Bengaluru) office. Off course, there are other like Akash, N B Prashanth and Saurabh Sood who contribute a lot to openSUSE and are my very good friends.


#### How many icons are currently on your desktop?


Well none, because of GNOME 3, otherwise there would have been plenty

#### Favorite game or console (in your childhood and nowadays)?


Lots and lots of games, the list is endless. Earlier when I was on Windows I remember playing carmaggadon, star gunner, flying tigers, xonix, Halo and others.
